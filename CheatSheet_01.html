  <p><h3><li>World Wide Web:</h3><ul>
  <p>&raquo 1985 the global internet began to profilerate in Europe and North America.
  <p>&raquo Bernes-Lee went on tu use the term hypermedia, becausehypertext wasnÂ´t able to inlude graphics, videos and a lot of ther things.
  <p>&raquo 2 November 1990 Bernes-Lee and his colleague Robert Cailliau started to build a "Hypertext project" called "WorldWideWeb".
  <p>&raquo At this point HTML and HTTP had already been in developement for about two months and the first Webs-Server wasabout one month from completing its first sucessful test.
  <p>&raquo The first photo in Web was published by Berned-Lee in 1992.
  <p>&raquo A NeXT Computer was used by Berners-Lee as the world's first web server and also to write the first web browser, WorldWideWeb, in 1990.
  <p>&raquo By Christmas 1990, Berners-Lee had built all the tools necessary for a working Web, the first web browser (which was a web editor as well) and the first web server.
  <p></ul>
  <h3><li>Web Server</h3><ul>
  <p>&raquo A webserver shall store, process and deliver webpages to clients. The communication between the server and the client takes place using http. Mostly delivered are HTML Documents. 
  <p>&raquo A web browser or a web crawler starts to communicate by making a request for a specific resource using HTTP or HTTPS. The server responds with the resource or an error. 
  <p>&raquo But content can also be received from clients. This is used e.g. for web forms. 
  <p>&raquo A lot of generic web servers nowadays also support server side scripting using a couple of scripting languages like PHP.
  <p></ul>
  <h3><li>Web Client</h3><ul>
  <p>&raquo Also known as Web Browser, a web client is an application for accessing information on the world wide web. It fetches information resources and displays them to an end device like a computer. 
  <p>&raquo The process is the following: The user inputs a URL, the rendering engine of the browser renders it and then displays it.
  <p></ul>
  <h3><li>Hello World </h3><ul>
  <p>&raquo The <!DOCTYPE> on the head of a html document exists to show the browser the version of html that is used. It's not always required but you should still use it always. 
  <p>&raquo The &ltbody&gt element contains all of the contents such as text, images and other.
  <p>&raquo The &lthead&gt element contains all of the metadata and things like the &ltstyle&gt tag, the &ltscript&gt tag or the &ltlink&gt tag.
  <p>&raquo The &lthtml&gt element shows the browser that the following document is a html document. It also is the root for all of the other tags and elements of the html document.
  <p>&raquo The &lttitle&gt element is required in a html document, it is basically just the title of the document. It is between the &lthead&gt tags.
  <p></ul>
